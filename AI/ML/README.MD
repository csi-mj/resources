   Use this course to learn some of the Python libraries to handle and analyse data
   It teaches numpy, pandas and matplotlib, very crucial in AI/ML field

   - NumPy:

   NumPy stands for Numerical Python and is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
   It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
   NumPy's arrays are more efficient than Python lists for numerical operations and are widely used for tasks involving linear algebra, random number generation, Fourier analysis, and more.

   - Pandas:

   Pandas is a powerful library built on top of NumPy that offers data structures and tools for data manipulation and analysis.
   It provides two primary data structures: Series (1-dimensional labeled arrays) and DataFrame (2-dimensional labeled data structures).
   Pandas simplifies tasks related to cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing data by offering functionalities like data alignment, reshaping, merging, grouping, and time series analysis.
   It's extensively used in data preprocessing, data exploration, and data wrangling tasks in data science projects.

   - Matplotlib:

   Matplotlib is a plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and publication-quality visualizations in Python.
   It offers a wide range of plotting functionalities for creating line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and more.
   Matplotlib provides flexibility and customization options for adjusting plot styles, labels, axes, annotations, and various other elements.
   It is often used in combination with other libraries like Pandas to visualize data and gain insights through graphical representations.
