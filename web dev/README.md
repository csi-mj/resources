Web Development consists of 2 main parts - Front-end and Back-end. Front-end is what you see on the screen - the website/web app, images, text, buttons and you can interact with it. Back-end is something that happens behind the scenes - fetching data from database, interacting with the server etc

## Front-end

Front-end consists of mainly 3 parts - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

- HTML is used to structure the website - like which text goes where, placement of images, creating tables, list, embedding video etc.

- CSS is used to style your website to make it look more appealing - like adding colors, changing font sizes, adding borders, border-radius, shadows etc

- JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the website - like what should happen if user clicks on this button, formatting data, etc. This is where you add logic to your website.
